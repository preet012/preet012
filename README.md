### Hi there! I'm Gurwinder👋

- 🔭 I work on the intersection of Machine Learning and Data Science. I have a soft spot for visual data though. 😄 
- 🌱 I'm currently learning to get better at my data engineering skills.
- 👯 I'm looking to collaborate on cool projects involving algorithm development for AI solutions to real world problems, specially interested in a mix of NLP and Computer Vision, and medical imaging.
- :v: I love reading, bouldering, biking and yoga.
<!--- ⚡ Fun fact: After my university, I went to Africa for a 2 week vacation, which ended up being 2 months of me doing gorilla trekking, mountain climbing and snorkeling in the bluest of the seas. 😄 -->
